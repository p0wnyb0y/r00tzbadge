This is my guide for setting up and programming the r00tz badge for DEF CON 26.

[This talk](https://youtu.be/EDJGuJVIoZY?t=674) is about the r00tz 2018 badge, and goes over some of its features.

### Getting started
You'll need to download the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software) first.

After that, read [this guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-feather-huzzah-esp8266/using-arduino-ide) over on the Adafruit site to get your computer working with the drivers and board.

If you happen to have a issue with these drivers on macOS High Sierra, Sierra, or Mojave, try using the legacy drivers. This may help with issues you may experience. If the board doesn't show up when you plug it in via microUSB, make sure that you are using a microUSB data cable.
