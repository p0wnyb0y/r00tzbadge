### Ready to compile!

![Toolbar](/r00tzbadge/articles/toolbar.png)

Once you finished all of the steps, hit the Compile button! (The light blue arrow pointing to the right.) You do not need to set the badge/board into any special mode, as it will be put into bootloading mode automatically.

If everything is setup right, the IDE should start uploading the program to your r00tz badge. Once it finishes uploading, you can now remove your badge from your computer and turn it back on.

If you happened to find a mistake in this tutorial/guide, feel free to fork this repo and fix it, then send it my way.

### Final words..
