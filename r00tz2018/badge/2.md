### Light up the way!
Next goal: get the correct libraries installed for the 'Adafruit 15x7 CharliePlex FeatherWing'. (The CharliePlex FeatherWing is the LED matrix that is attached to your badge!)

Read through [this guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-15x7-7x15-charlieplex-led-matrix-charliewing-featherwing/usage) and install the IS31FL3731 and Adafruit GFX libraries.

#### Where do I place the libraries?
Unzip the files containing the IS31FL3731 and Adafruit GFX libraries. Take the unzipped files and place them in the 'libraries' folder, which is inside of your Arduino folder.

If you don't know where your Arduino folder is located:
- macOS & Windows: Documents folder

Once you place the libraries into their spot, continue on!
